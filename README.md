# Royal-School
A simple education website using php and storing data in a database
creating a database named school
a table created named students, after that; adding columns to the table to store data.
A home page for anyone, displaying all the students we have.
Another page which is accessed only if you logged in with some conditions, 
from this page, you can add, edit, remove and show a single student, 
all that using sql queries and connecting it to the database we created, so that any changes are applied there.
of course, using bootstrap and fontawesome to add navbar, footer and to make the website looks good.
